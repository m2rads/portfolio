                            a computer science student. Currently, I am 
                            finishing my studies at Langara College in rainy 
                            Vancouver, BC. </h1>
                        <p> I came to Canada when I was 17 years old and away from my family.
                            Looking for ways to adapt to the new environment, 
                            I discovered coding. Learning to code gave me the ability
                            to express my passion in life. Building and designing 
                            simple programs was the beginning of becoming an individual.  </p>
                        <p>These days, my time is spent on coding, researching and experimenting
                            with new technologies. I also spend time writing blogs to find an answer 
                            to the questions that I once had. </p>
                        <p>Outside of the routine, you would find me dreaming about soccer,
                            playing snooker and looking for fine coffees.</p>
